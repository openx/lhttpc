Version 1.10.3:
* Fix a crash in lhttpc_stats that can happen when a PID has more than one
  socket.  This error points to an unfixed bug in the lhttpc_stats connection
  tracking, but we don't want to crash.

Version 1.10.2:
* Update a pool's max_connections on each call, and apply max_connections when
  returning a socket to the connection pool.  This allows the pool size to be
  reduced more quickly than waiting for open sockets to be closed by the
  remote.

Version 1.10.1:
* Include connection failures in stats collection; previously these were not
  tracked.

Version 1.10.0:
* Change details of retry handling on connection failure.  Previously a
  failure was always retried; now a failure is only retried if an existing
  socket is being used, under the assumption that the failure is because the
  remote end closed the existing socket before the current request tried to
  use it.
* Change default for send_retry option from 1 to 0, so that requests will not
  be retried by default (unless they are reusing an existing connection, in
  which case a new connection is opened and they are retried once).

Version 1.9.0:
* Use max_connections and connection_lifetime options on each request to
  decide whether a new socket can be opened and, if so, how long it will live.
  This allows the size of the connection pool and the connection lifetimes to
  be changed without having to restart the application.

Version 1.8.0:
* Write host/port/ssl to process dictionary in lhttpc_lb for debugging.

Version 1.7.0:
* Optimize header handling.

Version 1.6.0:
* Add request_limit and connection_lifetime options to lhttpc:request.
* Small fixes to lhttpc specs.
* Convert from os:timestamp/0 to erlang:monotonic_time/0.
* Convert rebar.config to rebar3.

Version 1.5.4:
* Remove ssl:seed/1 call, which was removed in OTP R14B.

Version 1.5.3:
* lhttpc:request spec fixes for Erlang 19 dialyzer.

Version 1.5.2:
* Don't emit output when a client dies before we can monitor it.

Version 1.5.1:
* Update specs to reflect that binary is allowed for request body in
  addition to iodata.

Version 1.5.0:
* Changes to compile under Erlang 18.

Version 1.4.0:
* Add lhttpc_stats module.

Version 1.3.3:
* Add lhttpc_dns:check_table function.
* Log a warning when the DNS cache is reset.

Version 1.3.1:
* DNS caching fix: Treat a DNS lookup that succeeds but returns no A
  records as a failure.

Version 1.3.0:
* Add caching of DNS lookups.  This is disabled by the default
  lhttpc.app file, but can be overridden by setting the lhttpc
  dns_cache env parameter.

Version 1.2.8:
* Add support for connect_options
    * Enables the user to pass socket options, for instance ip and port,
      that will be used when connecting the socket
    * Allows the user to specify SSL options during the connect phase
* Add support for "streaming" of entities
* Add start/0 and stop/0
* Fix for unexpected messages after request has been completed
    * When the client process is trapping exits (which some eunit versions seem
      to be doing by default) there would be {'EXIT', Pid, normal} messages left
      after completing requests which came from the lhttpc_client process.
      These are now avoided.
* Add rebar support (thanks to Benoit Chesneau)

Version 1.2.5:
* Fix for decoding chunked HTTP responses with extraneous whitespace
  (thanks to Bob Ippolito)
    * api.facebook.com includes extra whitespace in its chunked HTTP response
      length, e.g. "6  \r\n" instead of "6\r\n". 

Version 1.2.4:
* Fix handling of HTTP response code 304 (patch by Ben Slavin)

Version 1.2.3:
* Fix handling of unexpected 100 Continue response (patch by Magnus Henoch)
 
Version 1.2.2:
* Fix Host header, add port number (reported by Benoit Chesneau)

Version 1.2.1:
* Fix confusion of arguments in request/9 (introduced in 1.2.0)

Version 1.2.0:
* Add support for options
    * {connect_timeout, Milliseconds}: Aborts the connect phase after
      Milliseconds
    * {send_retry, N}: The client will retry sending the request N times
      if the connection is closed
* Add support for downloading chunked transfer encoding
* More consistent error handling
    * The client can either return {ok, Result} or {error, Reason}. Reason
      (which wasn't very well defined before) can now be:
        * connection_closed: The server closed the connection on us (N times
          in case it happens just after sending the request) 
        * connect_timeout: If the TCP stack gives up or we hit the
          connect_timeout option
        * timeout: If the overall request timeout value is hit
    * All other errors (socket, protocol etc. will result in a runtime error)
* Better connection handling (issues #2 and #3 on bitbucket.org/etc/lhttpc)
    * Now understands what to do with connections to servers < HTTP/1.1
    * Now respects "Connection: close" in request headers, which means
      clients can choose to not use persistent connections
* RFC Compliance
    * Fix reading of chunked encoding since section 3.6 claims that "All
      transfer-coding values are case-insensitive"
    * Support for responses that doesn't have an entity body (thanks to Steve
      Ellis)
        * No body for the HEAD and OPTIONS (unless indicated for the latter)
          methods
        * Don't try to read a body when receiving a 204 status

Version 1.1.2:
* Fix minor error with {active, once} instead of {active, true} in manager
* Remove socket and try to find another if the manager can't set controlling
  process due to socket error
* Improve test suite 

Version 1.1.1:
* Fix problem with empty lists in dicts when last socket is consumed
* Improve test suite to include cover report 

Version 1.1.0:
* Support for configurable connection timeout 

Version 1.0.0:
* Initial version
* Persistent connections have hardcoded timeout
